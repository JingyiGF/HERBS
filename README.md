# HERBS
## A Python-based GUI for Histological E-data Registration in Brain Space

HERBS is an intuitive, interactive and interesting tool for image registration, the process of identifying a spatial transformation that maps images to a template such that corresponding anatomical structures are optimally aligned, or in other words, a voxel-wise ‘correspondence’ is established between the images and template.

HERBS has been tested on Windows (10 and 11), MacOSx (Mojave - Monterey), Linux (Kubuntu ), and as a python application, it should run in all environments supporting python 3.8-3.10 and PyQt5 5.15.4 as a GUI framework. For details, please see HERBS CookBook.

HERBS provides users:

- 2D and 3D visualisation of brain atlas.
- 

## Install

```python
$ pip install herbs
```

## Usage
