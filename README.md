# HERBS
A Python-based GUI for Histological E-data Registration in Brain Space


HERBS is an open source, extensible, intuitive and interactive software platform for image visualisation and image registration. Where the image registration is the process of identifying a spatial transformation that maps images to a template such that corresponding anatomical structures are optimally aligned, or in other words, a voxel-wise ‘correspondence’ is established between the images and template.

HERBS has been tested on Windows 10, MacOSx (Big Sur - Monterey), Linux (Kubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS), and as a python application, it should run in all environments supporting python 3.8.10-3.10.4 / 3.9.0 with PyQt5 >= 5.14.2 as a GUI framework. For details, please see HERBS CookBook (on going).

HERBS provides users:

- 2D and 3D visualisation of brain atlas volume data and arbitrary slicing.
- Image registration with interactive local elastic deformation methods in current version.
- 2D and 3D visualisation of user defined data.

## Install

```python
$ pip install herbs
```

Please install the newest version of HERBS.

## Usage

```python
import herbs
herbs.run_herbs()
```

After running the above scripts, a GUI window will pop up. Users can download atlas and upload images for further process,

For more information, please read HERBS CookBook (on going) or check the Tutorial folder for corresponding functionalities.

## Atlas Storage

- <span style="font-weight:700;font-size:18px">
    Do not store Atlases inside HERBS folder. 
</span>
When downloading Atlases, HERBS asks users to select the folder to store the atlas. Please choose a folder other than HERBS folder.

- <span style="font-weight:700;font-size:18px">
    Save different Atlas in different folders. 
</span>
When downloading an atlas other than the one you already have, please store it in another folder.


## Some Pre-Requirement Issues

- In order to run HERBS properly, 64 bit operating systems and 64 bit Python are required.

- 3D visualisation in HERBS depends on OpenGL, if you face to the problem that no OpenGL is installed on your machine, please see (https://www.opengl.org) to download and install accordingly. 

- For the current version of HERBS, Python is required to be installed. Please see (https://www.python.org) for downloading.

- If you would like to install HERBS through terminal, **pip** is required. 
	- Check if pip is installed, `pip --version` or `pip help`.
	- Use `python3 -m ensurepip` for MacOS to install pip.
	- Use `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py` to download requiring file for installing pip on Windows and `python get-pip.py` to install pip.
	- Please update pip to the newest version before installing HERBS.

- We strongly recommend users to use Python and install packages with virtual environment. For no-coders, we strongly recommend to use IDE to create environment at the moment. A desktop app of HERBS is coming soon.   

## Some Dependencies Conflict Issues
- The initial of test of HERBS was carried on Windows 10 (one user claimed he had a Windows 11 before, but it turned out to be a Windows 10 at the end), MacOSx (Big Sur - Monterey) and Linux (Kubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) with Python==3.8.10 and the corresponding dependencies listed in CookBook. 

- The current tests showed that different version of Python accepts different versions of dependencies. For example, PyQt5 == 5.14.2 works when Python>=3.8.10, PyQt5 >= 5.15.0 works when Python==3.9 and PyQt5 >= 5.15.5 works when Python==3.10 on a Windows 10. 

- HERBS depends on Numba and the valid version for Numba is highly depends on the version of Numpy. For example, Numba == 0.54 only works when Numpy <= 1.20 and Numba == 0.55 only works when Numpy <= 1.21 and so on.

- If you face to these kinds of problems, the easiest way to install HERBS is to create a new environment and install HERBS without previous installation of any dependencies.
