## Important Thing You Need To Know Before You Upload External Data

Since all external data is required to be in atlas space, 
the relation between original atlases and transposed atlases in HERBS is important.

For the users who already have downloaded Allen Mouse CCFv3 and Waxholm Rat Atlas v1.01 through HERBS and processed them,
please copy the corresponding extra file from https://github.com/JingyiGF/HERBS/tree/main/Extra_Data to your local file folder where you saved the atlas.

For the new users, after you processed the atlas, the mentioned file will be already saved in your atlas folder. 
Thus you can upload external data without extra attention.
