## Create Enviroment in Anaconda

Here we take Anaconda on Windows 10 for example. 

- After clicking Anaconda, a main window will show up. On the left panel, there are tabs for 'Home', 'Environments', 'Learning' and 'Community'. All available softwares are listed in the main area, and there is a 'Applications on' combobox on top. This combobox shows which enviroment you are using. e.g. I already chose an enviroment called 'conda38_3' in the screeshot. But when you start Anaconda, an enviroment called 'base' is the one shows there.

- To create a new enviroment, click 'Enviroments' tab. Before creating any new enviroments, you will only see 'base (root)' enviroment which has a small triangle arrow next to it. Click 'Creat' button on the bottom, a 'create new enviroment' window will popup. Enter a name for your desier enviroment and click 'create'. The screenshot shows an enviroment 'conda38_3' is created. Click the enviroment you would like to use and you will see the small triangle arrow move to the enviroment you clicked.
